# SQl-Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT 
The purpose of our project is to understand the number of retiring employees by their job titles and identifying which employees are eligible to part of the mentorship program. The Tables created show retiring employees by title of all employees that were born between January, 1 1965 and December, 31 1965.

Results 
With the retirment_titles table we are able to display employees first name, last name, their title, and how long they have worked at each position over their time with the company.
The unique titles table is showing the most recent information about the  employees.
And the final table that we created mentorship_eligibility shows us employees that are eligible to be part of the program

Summary
The number of roles needed to be filled is unsure, this is because their is a large number of senior workers retiring without handing off the responsibilities. There is a uncertinty that the work load can be complted with many seniors leaving. New employees have to adopt to the company's culture and work fast to ensure the company continues to perform. There should be enough support for the new workers, the company still has a decent amonut of senior workers that can guide the new generation to be suceesful.
